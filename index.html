### What kinds of tea are aged?

<p class="fragment">
Lots of tea can be aged, actually.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
But let's talk about Puer tea!

### Puer?

Also Pu-er, Pu'er, Pu-erh, etc.

普洱茶

### Let's quickly review the six categories of all tea:

- <span style="color:#44fd44;">Green tea</span>: tea leaves that have been quickly heated to stop oxidation.
- <span style="color:#c3c3c3;">White tea</span>: tea leaves that have been sun-dried for a while, and then fully dried, allowing only partial oxidation.
- <span style="color:yellow;">Yellow tea</span>: similar to green tea, but undergoing a special bamboo steaming process.
- <span style="color:red;">Red/Black tea</span>: tea leaves that have been bruised, then allowed to oxidize for a long time.
- <span style="color:#369efd;">Oolong/Wulong</span>: tea leaves that have been carefully bruised and oxidized for a variable period.
- <span style="color:#ff753c;">Puer</span>: tea leaves that have been sun-dried, steamed, and carefully aged.

### Puer is a very old style

Native to Yunnan province (South-Western China).

Like many aged things, Puer came about because it took a long time to ship things from one place to another.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

People in Yunnan needed to trade their tea leaves for horses from Tibet, and that journey was not fast.

They discovered that if they steamed their leaves and pressed them into cakes, the tea was much more manageable.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
That old aging process was merely a side-effect of the journey, not a practiced skill. Puer has come a long way since then.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
Modern Puer falls into two sub-categories:

<span style="color:yellow;">Sheng</span> ("raw") and <span style="color:#ff753c;">Shou</span> ("ripe").
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
<span style="color:yellow;">Sheng</span> or "raw" Puer is the older of the two styles, having been around since the dawn of tea processing.

<span style="color:#ff753c;">Shou</span> or "ripe" Puer is much newer, having been popularized around the 1970s. However, most of the Puer you will encounter in the West today is going to be Shou.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
The difference? Natural or accelerated aging.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
<span style="color:yellow;">Raw Puer</span> is crafted by steaming sun-dried leaves, pressing them into bricks, and then aging.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
Young Raw Puer has golden amber liquor with aromas of cedar and spice.

With skillful aging, in around 20 years those same leaves produce an inky black infusion with the aroma of a beautiful old library.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
<span style="color:#ff753c;">Ripe Puer</span> is created in much the same way but before pressing the leaves are pile fermented. This process greatly increases the bacterial effects and ages the tea more quickly.

The resulting tea has much of the same character as older Raw Puer, but with less nuance.
					</script>
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
Despite its simpler flavors, Ripe Puer is much more popular since it can so quickly be brought to market.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
Both Raw and Ripe Puer can be delicious no matter their age, but just as no two cups of tea are the same, no two people like the same tea in the same way.
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
Drink lots of different tea!
